# Release workflow — "push to github"

Runbook for when the user explicitly says something like "push to github" /
"release this" / "push origin main". Not run automatically, not implied by
finishing an unrelated task — see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Guardrails" section.

This is linked to the `UU-BUEM` organization and pushed to the repo
`https://github.com/UU-BUEM/occupancy`

## Steps

1. **Survey the diff since the last release.**
   - `git status`, `git diff`, `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline` (last
     tag: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`).
   - Decide whether `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` section already covers
     everything, or needs updating — this repo follows [Keep a
     Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) +
     [SemVer](https://semver.org/); see existing entries for the
     Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated style.
   - Decide whether `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/*.md` need updating for
     anything durable the diff introduced (new gotcha, new convention, a
     resolved open-item) — same judgment as any other session, not a
     mechanical step.

2. **Determine the version bump.** This repo uses `setuptools_scm`
   (`pyproject.toml`: `version_file = "src/occupancy/_version.py"`) — the
   git tag *is* the version, no version string to hand-edit elsewhere.
   Existing tags follow `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (see `git tag --list`). Pick
   the bump per CHANGELOG's SemVer convention (breaking → MAJOR,
   backward-compatible addition → MINOR, fix-only → PATCH) based on the
   actual diff — don't default to PATCH without checking.

3. **Move `[Unreleased]` → the new version heading** in `CHANGELOG.md`
   (`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, today's date), leaving a fresh empty
   `[Unreleased]` above it. Commit doc changes (CHANGELOG + any CLAUDE.md/
   `.claude/` updates from step 1) as their own commit before tagging.

4. **Run the local CI mirror** (exact steps from
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, in the `occupancy_env` conda env — this
   repo has no plain `python`/`conda` on PATH by default in this
   environment; use the full interpreter path, e.g.
   `C:\Users\sahoo002\.conda\envs\occupancy_env\python.exe`, or resolve
   `conda.bat` under the anaconda install first):

   ```text
   ruff check src/ tests/
   mypy src
   pytest -q --cov=occupancy --cov-report=xml
   python -m occupancy --help
   ```

   Fix or clearly report any failure before proceeding — don't tag/push on
   a red local CI mirror. `python validate.py` (repo-root script, not part
   of CI itself) is a useful extra sanity check covering the same ground
   plus package-structure checks — see `CLAUDE.md` dev commands.

5. **Show the user a summary before pushing**: the version chosen and why,
   the CHANGELOG diff, and the local CI mirror result. This is the last
   checkpoint before an action that touches the shared remote — confirm
   before continuing unless the user has said to run this workflow fully
   autonomously.

6. **Tag and push.**

   ```text
   git tag vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

7. **Monitor CI on GitHub** (`gh run list --branch main --limit 1`, then
   `gh run watch <run-id>`, or `gh run watch` on the latest run) until it
   completes. Report the result (pass/fail, and which step if it failed) —
   don't just fire-and-forget the push.
